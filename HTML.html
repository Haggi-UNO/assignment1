    <h1>Kobe's Website</h1>
    <body>
        <p>This website for assignment 1 will be dedicated to Kobe, the family dog.</p>
        <p>Kobe is a golden retriever born on February 3, 2022, which so happens to also be National Golden Retriever Day!
        He is an energetic pup that loves playing tug of war and, unsurprisingly, fetch!</p>
